# ConsolidationProject
This is a simple word guessing game written in Python, created by Pari Kansara. The game allows multiple players to guess a word of length 5 from a predefined word bank. Each player can make letter guesses and has a limited number of word guesses before their game ends.

# Instructions
Setup: Call this program in the command line as python WordGuessingGame.py x, where x is the number of players.

# Gameplay:
- Players take turns guessing letters in the word.
- Each correct letter guess is revealed in the word.
- Players can also choose to guess the entire word.
- If a player guesses the entire word correctly, they win the game.
- Players have a limited number of word guesses (3) before their game ends.
- The game ends when all players have used their word guesses.
  
# Word Bank: 
The words used in the game are all of length 5 and are sourced from the Wordle word bank.
# How to Play
- Run the program with the desired number of players.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to make letter guesses and word guesses.
- Keep track of your score as you play.
# Notes
Ensure that the words.txt file containing the word bank is present in the same directory as the program.
Players should enter their guesses carefully to avoid premature game exits.
Have fun playing and see who can guess the word correctly with the fewest guesses!
